# gwas_eqtl


This repository containts scripts used for the analyses in the article "Limited overlap of eQTLs and GWAS hits due to systematic differences in discovery".

- gwas_process: scripts in this directory download GWAS sum stats from the Neale lab website, and extract and LD clump the GWAS hits per trait

- eqtl_process: scripts in this directory LD clump the GTEx eQTLs per gene per tissue

- gwas_props: scripts in this directory compute a range of SNP and gene properties of GWAS hits

- eqtl_props: scripts in this directory compute a range of SNP and gene properties of eQTLs
